# random_album

Just fooling around with the Spotify API and a Raspberry Pi. This is the code that enabled one of
my [lockdown mini projects](https://gothick.org.uk/2020/05/31/long-form-lockdown-project-a-random-album-player/),
basically a box that lets me play a random *album* (rather than song) based on one of my playlists at the touch
of a button.
